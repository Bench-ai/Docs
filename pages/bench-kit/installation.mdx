## Automatic Installation

We recommend creating a new Bench AI project using `pip`, which links everything automatically for you. To install run:

pip install git+https://github.com/Bench-ai/BenchKit.git

Verify the installation by running:
```bash filename="> Terminal" copy
bench-kit --version
```
