pip install git+https://github.com/Bench-ai/BenchKit.git
```

Verify the installation by running:
```bash filename="> Terminal" copy
bench-kit --version
```

## Sync Your Project to Bench AI

Now that you have Bench Kit installed on your code base, let's connect your code to your project on the [website!](https://bench-ai.com)

All code intended to migrate must be written inside the project.

A project must have the three main features: <b>models</b>, <b>dataloaders</b>, and <b>training scripts</b>.

### Command Parameters
The start-project command takes in two parameters: <b>project-id</b> and <b>api-key</b>

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout>
    <b>Project IDs</b> can be found on the banner of you project's information page. It can also be found in your project's settings.
</Callout>

<Callout>
    <b>API Keys</b> are generated when you first create your project and only shown once. If you wish to reset it, go to your project settings to do so.
</Callout>

### Run Command
