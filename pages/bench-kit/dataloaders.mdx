# Bench Kit Dataloaders

After starting a project you should see a Datasets folder with a ProjectDatasets file.

## Migrate your Data to the Cloud

After you have completed the setup of your dataloader, run the command below to start the data migration:

```bash filename="> Terminal" copy
python manage.py migrate-data
```

If you'd like to migrate a specific dataset, run the command below:

```bash filename="> Terminal" copy
python manage.py migrate-data <dataset-name>
```
