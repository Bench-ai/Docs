# Trackers
---
## Preface

Graphs can tell us if our model is over fitting, performing poorly, or exceeding expectations. This is why `benchkit`
has direct integrations to top of the line tracking systems such as Wandb, CometML and Tensorboard while also
providing our own in house graphing system.

## Bench

The Bench Tracker allows users to track their experiments using our visualisation suite. Everything works out of the box
and integrates directly into the websites gui. It is the preferred tracker to use for the full bench experience!

### Graphs

#### Time Series

```python filename="TrainScript.py" copy
from benchkit.tracking.graphs.time_series import TimeSeries

train_loss_graph = TimeSeries("train loss graph",
                              "train loss",
                              "epochs",
                              "loss")
```

The time series graph is a standard cartesian plane graph.

This graph is extremely useful when displaying sequential data, such as loss over epochs, and will look like such.

##### `__init__`

###### Parameters

- **graph_name**: str
    + The name of the graph will be displayed as a title

- **line_names**: str | tuple[str]
    + The names of the lines to be displayed on the graph

- **x_axis_name**: str
    + The name of what the x-axis represents

- **y_axis_name**:
    + The name of what the y-axis represents

##### `.log`

```python filename="TrainScript.py" copy
train_loss_graph.log_value({"train loss": 0.0}, step=0)
```

###### Parameters
- **values**: dict
    + A dict where one key value pair must be `<line name>`: `<y axis value>`. The name being the name provided to the BenchGraph object

- **step**: int
    + The x-axis point for all the y-axis points being passed in the values dict
