# Trackers
---
## Preface

Visualizing your models performance is a central part of understanding your model. Graphs can tell us if our model
is over fitting, performing poorly, or exceeding expectations. This is why `bench-kit` has direct integrations to top of the line
tracking systems such as Wandb, CometML and Tensorboard while also providing our own in house graphing system.

## Bench

The Bench Tracker allows users to track their experiments using our visualisation suite. Everything works out of the box
and integrates directly into the websites gui. It is the preferred tracker to use for the full bench experience!

### get_bench_tracker
to start using the tracker call the `get_bench_tracker` method.

```python filename="TrainScript.py" copy
from BenchKit.Tracking.Tracker import get_bench_tracker
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as opt
from Models.ProjectModels import MyModel
from BenchKit.Tracking.Graphers.TimeSeries import TimeSeries

loss_fn = nn.BCELoss()
model = MyModel(64)
optim = opt.Adam(params=model.parameters(), lr=1e-2)

tracker_config = {
        "epochs": 10,
        "bs": 16,
        "lr": 1e-2
    }

train_loss_graph = TimeSeries("train loss graph",
                              "train loss",
                              "epochs",
                              "loss")

config_id, acc, model, loss_fn, optim = get_bench_tracker(tracker_config,
                                                         [train_loss_graph],
                                                         model,
                                                         loss_fn,
                                                         optim)
```
#### Parameters

- **config**: dict
    + A dict of hyperparameters being used on the model

- **graph_list**: list["BenchGraph"]
    + A list of `BenchGraph objects`. These are the graphs that the tracker will write too, can be seen on the site,
        and through the cli

- **args**
    + All the items you wish to prepare: models, schedulers, optimizer, loss function, datasets, etc.

- **kwargs**: Optional
    + All the extra arguments you wish to give to the accelerator

#### Returns

- **config_id**: str
    + The id of the model config

- **acc**: Accelerator
    + The accelerator

- **args**:
    + The prepared objects

You may have noticed that the method takes in a list of graphs. This list tells bench how many graphs you wish to see
and what types they are.

### Graphs

#### Time Series

```python filename="TrainScript.py" copy
from BenchKit.Tracking.Graphers.TimeSeries import TimeSeries

train_loss_graph = TimeSeries("train loss graph",
                              "train loss",
                              "epochs",
                              "loss")
```

The time series graph is a standard cartesian plane graph.

This graph is extremely useful when displaying sequential data, such as loss over epochs, and will look like such.

##### `__init__`

###### Parameters

- **graph_name**: str
    + The name of the graph will be displayed as a title

- **line_names**: str | tuple[str]
    + The names of the lines to be displayed on the graph

- **x_axis_name**: str
    + The name of what the x-axis represents

- **y_axis_name**:
    + The name of what the y-axis represents

##### `.log`

```python filename="TrainScript.py" copy
from BenchKit.Tracking.Tracker import get_bench_tracker

train_loss_graph = TimeSeries("train loss graph",
                              "train loss",
                              "epochs",
                              "loss")

config_id, acc, model, loss_fn, optim = get_bench_tracker(tracker_config,
                                                         [train_loss_graph],
                                                         model,
                                                         loss_fn,
                                                         optim)

acc.log({"train loss": 10,
        "graph": "train loss graph"},
        step=1)
```

###### Parameters

- **values**: dict
    + A dict where one key value pair must be `graph`: `<graph name>`. The name being the name provided to the BenchGraph object
    + All other key pairs must be the name of the line, and it's y-axis value. The name must match the line name given in the BenchGraph
  object

- **step**: int
    + The x-axis point for all the y-axis points being passed in the values dict
