## Sync Your Project

After installing `benchkit` we can begin connecting your codebase to your Bench AI project

### Run Command

Run the following command in the root directory to connect your project and sync:
```bash filename="> Terminal" copy
benchkit start-project <project-id> <api-key>
```
import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout>
    <b>Project IDs</b> can be found on the banner of you project's information page. It can also be found in your project's settings.

### Directory Structure
Upon starting your project you will notice this directory structure

```plaintext
|-- datasets
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- project_datasets.py
|
|-- models
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- project_models.py
|
|-- dependencies.txt
|-- manage.py
|-- train_script.py
```

- In the `datasets` directory you will add your datasets and dataloaders
- In the `models` directory you will add files related to your model
- You will add your training process to the `train_script.py` file
- You will add additional dependencies besides `pytorch` and `benchkit` in the `dependencies.txt` file
- The `manage.py` will never be edited and will be used to make migrations to the cloud.

All this will be covered more in depth in the following sections
