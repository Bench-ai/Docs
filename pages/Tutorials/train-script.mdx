# Train Script and Code Migration

Bench AI offers users top of the line servers, in various different configurations.
Users can train their models on up to 8 gpu's, however to fully utilize these configurations requires the use of
distributed training libraries.

## Hugging Face Accelerate

`bench-kit` directly integrates with Hugging Face Accelerate allowing users to train their models on distributed systems
without needing to change most of their code.

Hugging Face Accelerate provides integrations with various model trackers, allowing users to use their favorite
trackers such as TensorBoard right out of the box. Hugging Face Accelerate also provides in depth features that allows users to optimize their distributed training pipeline. All of which can be found in
the [Accelerate docs â†—](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/index).

For the rest of the section I will show the essentials of what you need to do, to turn your regular Pytorch training script into a
Accelerate compatible script.
