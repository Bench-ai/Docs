# Experiments

### Experiment Overview
Experiments are what allow you to train your model on the cloud. Each experiment is correlated to one server on the cloud, and
you can run multiple experiments at the same time, allowing for different model versions to be concurrently trained.
This parallel training approach allows for faster model comparison for performance evaluation.

### Creating an Experiment
Prior to creating an experiment, ensure that your dataset and model was successfully migrated onto the cloud.

To get started, navigate to your target project within your [Dashboard ↗](https://bench-ai.com/dashboards) and inside, click on "Train"
<Callout>
    <b>Note:</b> If you haven't already migrated your dataset and model to the cloud via BenchKit, you'll instead be taken
    to a page instructing you on how to do so. Complete this step before proceeding.

</Callout>
Next, click on "Create Experiment" and provide details for these fields:
* <b>Experiment Name</b>
* <b>Version</b> - Train a specific model iteration/version, see the section titled <b>Experiment Versions</b> below for more details.
* <b>Server Type</b> - Determines the cloud server to train the model on. Each cloud server type has different
hardware so it's up to you to determine which one best fits your needs.
* <b>API Key</b> - Generated when you first made a project
<Callout>
    Every API Key is unique to their respective project so ensure that you use the correct API Key for each project.
    If you forget your API Key, you can reset it in the project settings.
</Callout>
Click "Submit" and you are now training on the cloud!
Once your experiment is done setting up, you'll see a new entry on the table. This table list out various information
regarding your project such as server status, progress, creation/update/termination timestamps, and messages.
<Callout>
     Content displayed under the messages section is contingent on what you setup to be displayed in your codebase

## Experiment Versions
When creating an experiment, you can select a specific iteration of your model's architecture. What makes
Bench AI unique is that you can run multiple experiments concurrently, each with different versions.
This is all done with just a couple clicks on our UI rather than having to go through the hassle of setting up training
for each version or having to wait for each one to conclude training before starting the next training session.
You can now quickly compare different model versions and identify which ones are more promising,
thus improving development efficiency.

You can train multiple model versions by simply creating multiple experiments and selecting a different version for each one.
Don't have multiple versions? See here to set up versioning for your models [here ↗](https://docs.bench-ai.com/Tutorials/train-script#versioning)

## Experiment Logs
When you create an experiment, experiment logs are also generated along with it, these logs are the cloud server's
terminal output, serving debugging and progress monitoring purposes.

### Accessing Logs
You can access your logs for a desired experiment by clicking on its row inside the experiments table.
The logs will also automatically refresh periodically and will stop updating once the experiment has been
terminated.

## Terminating Experiments
Upon experiment completion, an automated server termination occurs after a brief period as this prevents
unnecessary charges for forgotten servers. You can also manually terminate your server(s) by selecting the experiment in
the table and clicking "Terminate Servers" and this will forcibly stop the training session.
